	//The present simple tense

	We need to use the present simple a lot in English, so it's really important to understand it well. Many students have
	problems with the form (or how to make it)
	
	Here's the positive form (positive means a normal sentence, not a negative or a question. This is sometimes called
	'affirmative')

	POSITIVE		POSITIVE SHORT FORM

	I am			I'm
	You are 		You're
	He is 			He's
	She is			She's
	It is 			it's
	We are 			We're
	They are		They're

	Next, here's the negative. It's very easy. You only add 'not'

	NEGATIVE		NEGATIVE SHORT FORM
	
	I am not		I'm not
	You are not 		You aren't
	He is not		He isn't
	She is not		She isn't
	It is not		it isn't
	We are not		We aren't
	They are not		They aren't

	And finally let's talk about the question form of the present simple with 'be'

	Firstly, here's the yes/no question form
	
	YES/NO QUESTION(Be)
	am I?
	are you?
	is he?
	is she?
	is it?
	is it?
	are we?
	are they?

	If you'd like to make a 'wh' question you just put the question word at the front
	
	WH QUESTIONS
	
	where		am I?
	what		are you?
	why		is he?
	who		is she?
	when		are we?
	how		are they? 

	With all other verbs we make the present simple in the same way
	
	the positive is really easy. It's just the verb with an extra 's' if the subject is 'he, she or it'. Let's take the verb 'play' as an example:
	
	POSITIVE (OF PLAY)

	I play
	you play
	he plays
	she plays
	it plays
	we play
	they play
	
		* Don't forget the 's' Even really advaced students do this!
		* for a fer verbs there is a spelling change before the 's'. For example 'study' becomes 'studies'
		* There are also few verbs which are irregular in the present simple
		1.- 'have' becomes 'has'
		2.- 'do' becomes 'does'
		3.- 'go' becomes 'goes'

	To make the negative form, you need to use 'do not' (don't) or 'does not' ('doesnt')

	NEGATIVE OF PLAY
	I do not play			I don't play
	You do not play			You don't play
	He does not play		He doesn't play
	She does not play		She doesn't play
	It does not play		It doesn't play
	We do not play			We don't play
	they do not play		They don't play

	How about the question form of the present simple tense?
	we use 'do' or 'does' before the subject to make the 'yes/no' question:

	YES/NO QUESTION (other verbs)
	
	do I play?
	do you play?
	does he play?
	does she play?
	does it play?
	do we play?
	does it play?
	do we play?
	do they play?	

	Just like with 'be' if you'd like to make a 'wh' question. you just put the question word at the front:
	
	WH QUESTIONS
	
	Where				do I play?
	what 				do you play?
	why				does he play?
	who 				does she play?
	when 				do we play?
	how 				do they play?
