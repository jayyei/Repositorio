** 3 Rules to Remember
    
    Fixed Position and %
    - The containing element is the viewport
    - if it has a width of 10%, it should have 10% of the containing width (in this case the viewport)

    Absolute position and %
    - The containing element is an ancestor wich is not position of static
    - The percentage unit of our element refers to this ancestor's content plus the padding

    Relative/static and %
    - The containing is the ancestor (only the containing)
    - Simply the closest ancestor which is a block element
