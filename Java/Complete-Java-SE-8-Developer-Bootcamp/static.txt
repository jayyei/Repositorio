//Static methods/variables are things that belongs to an especific class

They can also be accessed by a class instance, it's weird but works.

You should notice (especially for the exam) that accessing static member with a null class reference
will not throw a NullPointerException.

Static methods cannot access instance variable or methods. Plus, we really shouldn't call static methods with an object reference
